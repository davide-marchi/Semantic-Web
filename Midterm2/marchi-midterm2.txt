Q09. Identify one assertion that would make the ontology inconsistent

Writing the following assertions will make the ontology inconsistent:

room1 isLocatedIn building1
room1 isLocatedIn building2
building1 DifferentFrom building2

This is because one room can only be in exactly one building.
The isLocatedIn object property is functional, and for this reason assessing that:

room1 isLocatedIn building1
room1 isLocatedIn building2

imply that building1 and building2 are the same buildings, and thus can not be different.

Q10. Verify and explain whether or not the created ontology (including the complex role
inclusion axiom defined in Q08) satisfies the global restrictions on the axioms of an OWL 2
DL ontology

The created ontology satisfy the 5 global restrictions:

1. Restriction on owl:topDataProperty -> Satisfied
   Because all the data properties introduced has been defined as subproperties of TopDataProperty,
   and not a single superproperty of TopDataProperty has been defined

2. Restrictions on datatypes -> Satisfied
   Because all the datatypes used in the ontology are from OWL 2 datatype map, and no data ranges
   or other datatypes have been defined

3. Restriction on simple roles -> Satisfied
   All the object propertites using min, max, functional, transitive... are simple object properties.
   The complex object property (chat) is not involved in any of them.

4. Restriction on property hierarchy -> Satisfied
   Because no cycles have been introduces in the hieriarchy, not even by the property chain

5. Restrictions on Anonymous Individuals -> Satisfied
   No anonymous individuals are present in the ontology
