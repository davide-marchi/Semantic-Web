The created ontology satisfy the 5 global restrictions:

1. owl:TopDataProperty: All the data properties introduced has been defined as subproperties of TopDataProperty, and not a single superproperty of TopDataProperty as been defined

2. Datatypes: All the datatypers used are from OWL 2 datatype map, and no ranges have been defined

3. Simple roles: All the object propertites using min, max, functional... are simple object properties. The complex object property uses none of them

4. Property Hierarchy: No cycles have been introduces in the hieriarchies, not even by the property chain

5. Anonymous indivisals: There are no anonymous individuals in the ontology

-------------------

1. Restriction on owl:topDataProperty -> This is satisfied because the ontology does not 
include any axiom on owl:topDataPropertyand any superpropertyof topDataProperty
was defined

2. Restrictions on Datatypes -> This is satisfied because the ontology:
• only uses datatypes from the OWL 2 datatype map 
• does not define any data range

3. Restriction on Simple Roles -> This is satisfied because no composite object property is 
used in an axiom of the forbidden types

4. Restriction on the Property Hierarchy -> This is satisfied because there is only one 
property chain in the ontologyand it does not introduce cycles

5. Restrictions on Anonymous Individuals -> This is satisfied because there are no 
anonymous individuals in our ontology
